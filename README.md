Summary: 
I employed a hybrid approach by integrating both predictive and adaptive methodologies as Agile, Scrum and deep analysis of risks and changes

Solution: 
I worked through the entire project lifecycle. Utilizing predictive methodologies, I created Stakeholder Analysis, Project Charter, Customer Survey Results. Additionally, showcasing adaptive methodology skills involved developing artifacts like user stories, product and sprint backlogs, and a burndown chart analysis. I also produced project status reports, change forms, and closeout reports to comprehensively represent my project management capabilities. 

Approach: 
I analyzed project documents to identify project requirements and evaluate stakeholders, completed a project charter and used it as a tool to align project scope and goals among stakeholders, identified tasks and milestones, documented and prioritized them in a project plan, defined quality management standards and explored how to effectively share qualitative data, demonstrated myprojectâ€™s impact through effective reporting
